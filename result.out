Caesar ciphers are a basic encryption technique in which each letter in the original text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Here, the fixed number of positions is referred to as the key for the cipher. For example, if the key is 4, then the mapping between the original and cipher alphabets will be as follows:

Original: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Cipher:   E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D
Caesar ciphers can be automatically broken by using the known letter frequencies of the language of the encrypted text. The frequencies for English as given on Wikipedia are available in the file LetFreq.txt that can be found from the instructorâ€™s website.

In this project, you will write a program that uses this data to crack the code for arbitrary Caesar ciphers. The input for your program is an encrypted file produced by using the Caesar Cipher with a key between 0 and 25. Note that in the file, only the letters are changed; all other characters are unchanged, and capitalization is preserved.

You need to define the following functions and use them in your program. Each function represents a step in the procedure that solves this problem, except for function rotate() which is a helper for this program. Note that function rotate() is quite simple, but it is a meaningful operation and using it makes your code more readable. 

Hey this is also a test to see if it works, just to be sure
